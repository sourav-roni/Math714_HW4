# This folder contains code for implemnting Euler explicit/upwind finite difference method for the inviscid Burgers' equation in Homework 4

1) In order to just run a single instance of scheme to observe the numerical solution, one can run the file "upwind.m". Note the value of N, i.e. the number of grid points as described in the question can be changed in this file.

Below is a plot showing the numerical solution when N=100 and at a time instance of 0.3

2) In order to generate the error plot for this scheme, one can run the file "QA_error_plot.m". 

Below, is an error plot.
